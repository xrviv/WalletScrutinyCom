## Analysis 

Wallet creation begins with app initialization. If the user selects "Create a wallet" with 12 words, a multicurrency wallet is created. The 12-word recovery phrases are provided in the "Wallet Management" section. Bitcoin deposit is available. 

The app's developers **did not make the source code available.**

We did [not find any relevant GitHub repository](https://github.com/search?q=xyz.ctrl.wallet&type=code) containing the app ID.

We also posted on [x.com](https://x.com/dannybuntu/status/1900819210101813276) to verify.
