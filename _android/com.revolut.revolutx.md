Revolut X [supports Bitcoin (BTC) deposits and withdrawals](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/cryptocurrencies/transferring-cryptocurrencies/withdrawing-cryptocurrencies/how-do-i-send-crypto-to-an-external-wallet) via the Bitcoin blockchain. This functionality is accessible to verified users, though still managed under a custodial framework. 

**Open Source Status**\
Revolut X is not open source. While Revolut maintains a GitHub presence [(revolut-engineering and revolut-mobile)](https://github.com/orgs/revolut-engineering/repositories), these repositories do not include the source code for the Revolut X app itself. This lack of open-source code prevents independent verification of the app's functionality and security.

**Reproducible Builds**\
There is no evidence that Revolut X supports reproducible builds. Without access to the source code and build processes, it's impossible to confirm that the distributed APK matches the source code, a key aspect of WalletScrutiny's reproducibility requirement.

**App Distribution and Platform Restrictions**\
Revolut X is available exclusively through the Google Play Store. Notably, the app has been [reported to block](https://community.e.foundation/t/sorry-revolut-is-not-supported-on-devices-with-custom-firmware/63282/91?page=5) usage on devices running custom firmware like GrapheneOS and /e/OS by checking specific system properties, such as `ro.build.user` and `ro.build.host`, and denying access if these indicate a non-standard environment . This behavior suggests a reliance on Google's Play Integrity API or similar mechanisms, which can hinder user freedom and transparency.


üîê **Custodial Nature**

Revolut X operates as a **custodial** platform. Users do not have direct access to their private keys. While the app allows for crypto withdrawals to external wallets, the custody model inherently requires a high level of trust in the platform's security and operational integrity.
