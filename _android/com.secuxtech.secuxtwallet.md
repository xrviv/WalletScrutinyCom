This app tries to detect its hardware wallet counterparts. If it doesn't detect them, it doesn't function. This app, by itself is **not a wallet**.

This is the companion app to the following: 

- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxnifty' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxneox' verdict='true' %}
- {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/secuxneogold' verdict='true' %}
