## App Description 

CoinDex is a non-custodial multi-chain wallet for Android, forked from the open-source Unstoppable Wallet. It supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana, and other networks. Users retain control of private keys and can manage cryptocurrencies and NFTs directly in the app. The fork includes support for on-chain decentralized swaps and integrates basic coin tracking tools.

## Analysis 

We installed the app and verified that it provides the seed phrases and has a bitcoin wallet. It is source-available but its repository seems to be an unsynced fork of {% include walletLink.html wallet='android/io.horizontalsystems.bankwallet' verdict='true' %}. 

There is a version mismatch between the repository and the app on Google Play. Ignoring the red-flags, this app is **for verification.**
