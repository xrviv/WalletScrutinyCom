## App Description from Google Play

- Supported assets are limited to BTC, ETH, ADA, DAI, and ETC.

OSL Japan holds registration with the Japanese Financial Services Agency (Kanto Local Finance Bureau No. 00023) and maintains primary membership in the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA).

## Analysis

- We signed up via the mobile app, but the verification email did not arrive.
- The website **coinbest.com** is inaccessible from our end despite using a vpn (Japan), proxfree or typing the IP address directly.
- While filling in the information in the iPhone version, {% include walletLink.html wallet='iphone/com.coinbest.bitcoinbestkk' verdict='true' %} we found support links to osl.com - this confirms that these apps are related.
- We found this description on the related osl.com website:
- We were able to find an [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20240908033138/https://www.coinbest.com/) entry dating back to September 08, 2024. Here the site describes the service as: 

> CoinBest Wallet
> ウォレット管理
> 暗号資産は、ネットワークから遮断されたコールドウォレットで全て管理。

Translated using Google Translate:

> All crypto assets are managed in a cold wallet isolated from the network.

This tells us that the service is a **custodial** service. Meanwhile, the 403 error page and the lack of verification email could signify that the app is possibly undergoing re-branding or decommissioning. It is best to keep an eye out for updates.
