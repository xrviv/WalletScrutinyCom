## Analysis 

Tando App is a non-custodial platform that does not generate private keys, relying on user-linked Lightning wallets. The app's integration with M-Pesa, a dominant mobile money platform in Kenya, allows seamless conversion of Bitcoin to KES for payments, with zero fees. 

So to summarize: 

- It does not hold nor generate private keys. It integrates various lightning wallets.
- They've claimed with no obvious technical documentation that their platform converts lightning BTC to USD, USD to KES and KES into the bank account or mobile money account of the user. [Source](https://www.blink.sv/blog/tando-bitcoin-adoption-in-kenya)

Based on this information, we conclude that this product is **not intended to serve as a bitcoin wallet**, but as a facilitator, enabling the seamless conversion of Bitcoin to KES for mobile money transactions.
