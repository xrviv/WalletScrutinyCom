## App Description 

The iCoin Mobile App serves as an interface for the iCoin Hardware Wallet, enabling users to view balances, conduct transactions, and manage digital assets. It functions only when synced with an iCoin Hardware Wallet, ensuring all sensitive operations remain on the hardware device.

-   **Wallet Synchronization:** Syncs Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts via encrypted Bluetooth or Air Gap (QR code scanning).
-   **Account Management:** Displays BTC and ETH balances, transaction history, and a portfolio breakdown.
-   **Transaction Signing:** Transactions are constructed on the mobile app, transferred to the hardware wallet for signing, then broadcasted via the mobile app.
-   **NFT & ERC-20 Support:** View, manage, and transfer ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets, with ETH required for transaction fees.
-   **Security Measures:** The hardware wallet never connects to the internet, ensuring private keys remain offline.
-   **Connectivity Options:** Users can choose between encrypted Bluetooth and Air Gap (QR scanning) for secure communication.
-   **Transaction Verification:** Signed transactions are sent back to the mobile app for blockchain broadcasting.
-   **QR Code Integration:** Easily copy or share addresses via QR codes for BTC, ETH, and ERC tokens.
-   **Multi-Asset Viewing:** Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs with portfolio visualization.
-   **Action Wheel Functions:** Enables account syncing, PIN management, and device settings adjustments.
-   **Hardware Wallet Setup:** Requires PIN creation and a 24-word seed backup, either printed or manually recorded.
-   **Secure Printer Support:** Optionally prints account details and seed phrases for offline backup.
-   **Firmware Updates:** Requires a USB-C connection to a PC or Mac with the iCoin Updater app installed.
-   **Market Price Monitoring:** Displays live asset prices and portfolio values.
-   **Manual and Biometric App Access:** Secured with a 6-digit PIN or biometric authentication.
-   **Gas Fees Management:** Users can adjust Ethereum network fees based on transaction priority and network congestion.

## Analysis 

The app description explicitly states that the app "cannot function unless synced with an iCoin Hardware Wallet". Key generation and backup happens on the hardware wallet side. The app's role is limited to transaction construction. As a companion app, the verdict is that it is **not a wallet**.
