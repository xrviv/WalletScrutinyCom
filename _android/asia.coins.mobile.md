Coins.ph Wallet
being a very broad product and not strongly focused on being a Bitcoin wallet
does not emphasize being an actual wallet by our definition and even if it was,
the lack of source code makes it impossible to verify this app.

Our verdict: This "wallet" is probably custodial but does not provide public source
and therefore is **not verifiable**.
