## App Description from Google Play 

> Send, store, exchange, withdraw and make purchases in all major cryptocurrencies with no limits...

## Analysis 

- We tested the app, but was not able to find any mnemonic phrases. 
- There was a BTC wallet that can send and receive.
- The app's [Terms](https://ncwallet.net/en/terms/) defines storage services and fees, for storing "dormant" cryptocurrencies with no transactions for more than 12 months.
- The terms also give the platform the right to "suspend the user's account" and "block all Cryptocurrencies" in that account. 
- This is clearly a **custodial** provider.
