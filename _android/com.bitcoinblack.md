> "Seamlessly manage your BitcoinBlackâ„¢ membership and card with our intuitive mobile app and receive 24/7 customer support."

> "Sign up with no credit checks required"

## Analysis 

This seems more like a membership, rather than a cryptocurrency wallet provider. We believe that the card is a branded Visa/Mastercard fiat credit card. The app could be nothing more than a crypto to fiat service with no cryptocurrency custodial service. 

- Membership entails a $99 one-time membership fee with a $9.99 monthly fee.
- It's listed funding methods include: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tether, USDC and USDT (TRC20)
- The project has its own token which was launched in an IDO

After installing the app, the user is asked to register - which we assume to include the one-time $99 membership fee. Hence, we were not able to test the app. 

Using deep search, we were not able to find any specification or documentation of how the app functions as a wallet (namely to send/receive or hold). In what fluff copywriting it uses, we only know that "crypto" can be transferred to the app and this is "seamlessly converted to USD", transferred to a bank and onto the credit card. 

ðŸš© It is similarly named to some suspicious ICOs with many different variations in the domain name. 

We've found:

- www.bitcoin.black
- www.bitcoinblack.cash
- www.bitcoinblack.net

We could not establish a link to any of the above-mentioned websites, but the name itself "Bitcoin Black" has a lot of negative vibes coming from bitcointalk.org and search engines.

Under its Terms of Service, we've found that the service points to https://black.io instead of bblack.io. 

It has a [staking program for its $CARD token](https://whitepaper.bblack.io/usdcard-tokenomics/burn-mechanism-and-staking-program-analysis). 

Suffice to say, this service targets high net worth (Bitcoin) users with a taste for luxury goods. It promotes "privacy" and provides access to "personalized concierge services, private jet access, and invitations to elite events". 

The keywords in our analysis are "seamless" and "instant conversion". This means that whatever cryptocurrency is sent to an address in the app, it gets converted to fiat - which forms our conclusion that this app **does not provide a cryptocurrency wallet**.
