## App Description from Google Play

* Harbor is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet supporting both EVM-compatible blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) and Solana, featuring transaction decoding and simulation capabilities to enhance security during web3 application interactions.

* The application implements specialized interfaces for DeFi operations and NFT management, allowing users to view and manage digital assets across multiple blockchain networks through a unified interface.

* Harbor integrates with decentralized applications via standard wallet connection protocols, enabling users to interact with smart contracts and web3 services while maintaining control of their private keys.

BitGo [acquired Harbor](https://blog.bitgo.com/formalizing-bitgos-support-for-security-tokens-38d7301d67c6) in February 2020, marking a strategic expansion beyond its core cryptocurrency custody business. Harbor was originally established in 2017 as a security token platform with a focus on tokenizing real estate and other securities. The acquisition included Harbor's broker-dealer license and transfer agent registration with regulatory authorities, allowing BitGo to become the first full-stack service provider in the digital securities space with capabilities spanning custody, issuance, trading, and transfer of tokenized securities.

## Analysis

Upon wallet creation, this warning is shown: 

<div class="alertBox"><div>Action Required: 

Harbor Wallet is shutting down due to vendor changes. You will need to migrate to a new wallet provider for ongoing access and visibility of your assets. Harbor access will cease at the end of September. 

On July 21st, balance and transaction info won't be displayed in Harbor.

Migration steps:

1. Retrieve your recovery phrase: Settings > Reveal Phrase.

2. Import this seed phrase to your new wallet provider.

This action ensures continued visibility of balance and transaction details while keeping your assets accessible.</div> </div>

We were still able to look around the app, and did **not find any BTC support**.
