## App Description

The [mSIGNA](https://github.com/ciphrex/mSIGNA) wallet, developed by Ciphrex Corporation, has not received any updates since August 2017, which strongly suggests the project is abandoned.

Due to its outdated codebase and the company's inactivity, mSIGNA should be considered unmaintained and potentially insecure for current use. It is **obsolete**.
