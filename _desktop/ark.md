## App Description

This desktop wallet **handled only ARK tokens and ARK Core-based assets**. It has Windows, macOS and Linux binaries. 

The **defunct** app has been archived since 2023-03-23, and does not support BTC. The binaries are still downloadable through its repository but no longer supported. Users are advised to use the [Ark Vault](https://app.arkvault.io/) instead.
