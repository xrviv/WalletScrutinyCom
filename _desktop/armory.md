## App Description

Bitcoin Armory is a desktop-based Bitcoin wallet focused on advanced security and cold storage. It supports full Bitcoin wallet functionality. 

Described in its repository:

> Manage multiple wallets (deterministic and watching-only), print paper backups that work forever, import or sweep private keys, and keep your savings in a computer that never touches the internet, while still being able to manage incoming payments, and create outgoing payments with the help of a USB key.

The wallet is **source-available** but very obsolete. Armory is best known for enabling secure air-gapped setups, multi-signature wallets, and deterministic key generation.
