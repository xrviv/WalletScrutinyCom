## App Description

Lily Wallet is a desktop application designed for managing Bitcoin in multisignature vaults. It emphasizes security and sovereignty by enabling users to create wallets with customizable multisig configurations using hardware wallets or air-gapped keys. 

It also supports advanced features like time-locked recovery paths, labeling, and account-level organization. Users retain full control of their keys and funds, with no reliance on third-party custody. It also allows coordination with a locally running Bitcoin Core node or third-party Electrum server, enhancing privacy and reliability.

It hasn't been updated since 2023.
