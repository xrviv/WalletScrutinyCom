## App Description

From their site, it is [described](https://fullynoded.app) as:

> Fully Noded is a family of iOS and macOS apps which enable you to utilize your own personal node (Bitcoin Core, LND, Core Lightning, and Join Market) to power your desktop and mobile wallets.

**FN Server**

> FN-Server is one click node installer and manager for Mac that makes it easy to self custody your bitcoin. FN-Server installs and manages Bitcoin Core, Join Market, Tor and in a near term future release will include Core Lightning and LND. Users can easily connect Fully Noded mobile apps (Plasma, FN, FN-BitcoinCore, FN-JoinMarket and Unify) to FN-Server.

**["OG" Fully Noded](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded/blob/master/Readme.md)**

> Self sovereign, secure, powerful, easy to use wallet that utilizes your own Bitcoin Core node as a backend. Providing an easy to use interface to interact with your nodes non wallet capabilities. Fully Noded® wallets are powered by PSBT's and descriptors. Fully Noded® acts as an offline signer using your node as a watch-only wallet as well as giving you full unfettered access to every wallet.dat in your nodes .bitcoin directory. C-Lightning and LND compatible for instant, unfairly cheap payments.

Though this app should be **for verification**, current guidelines do not prescribe a method for verifying the reproducibility of macOS apps - yet. While source-available, verification for this is a work in progress.
