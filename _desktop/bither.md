## App Description

The Bither desktop wallet has not received updates since 2017-05-18, and is considered obsolete. However, the application remains downloadable as a .tar archive from the official website and was successfully launched and tested on Ubuntu 24.04 in April 2025.

The wallet provides a dual-mode cold/hot architecture, allowing users to create HD wallets, import/export keys, and monitor addresses in watch-only mode. Its interface and basic functionality are still operational. It is however, very **obsolete**.
