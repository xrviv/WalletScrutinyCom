## App Description

Specter Desktop Wallet is a Bitcoin-only, open-source desktop wallet developed by Crypto Advance GmbH, a company based in Munich, Germany, founded in 2019 by Stepan Snigirev and Moritz Weitersheim.

The wallet focuses on self-custody, supporting multi-signature configurations and hardware wallet integration, catering to security-conscious users and advanced setups.

App initialization begins with allowing the user to choose to connect between an Electrum server or Bitcoin Core. Once connected, the user is asked to [connect a signing device](https://specter.solutions/docs/desktop/DeviceCreationGuide/) (hardware wallet). Only then will the user be able to create a wallet. The seed phrases come from the hardware device.

This app should be **for verification.**
