## App Description

This is a [browser extension.](https://www.lolli.com/extension/install)

Lolli provides a rewards platform where users earn bitcoin or USD cashback from partner retailers. Users are not required to set up a personal Bitcoin wallet to begin earning; instead, Lolli credits rewards to an internal wallet system, managed via its own infrastructure. While [Lolli states](https://www.lolli.com/help) that it is not a custodian of bitcoin in a legal or regulatory sense, it acknowledges that users have a contractual right to redemption, and that it seeks to maintain assets backing user balances. Until withdrawal, funds are stored within Lolliâ€™s environment, and the ability to redeem them is subject to conditions such as minimum balance thresholds and retailer confirmation periods. Therefore, [Lolli is custodial](https://www.lolli.com/help) in terms of access and control, despite its nuanced legal positioning.

- Rewards become withdrawable after a ~90-day confirmation period.  
- Bitcoin can be transferred to any address; USD to a U.S. bank (min. $15).  
- Redemption is subject to terms and platform availability.  
- Lolli retains full control over funds until withdrawal is initiated.
