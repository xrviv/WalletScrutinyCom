## App Description

This is a [browser extension.](https://www.lolli.com/extension/install)

Lolli provides a rewards platform where users earn bitcoin or USD cashback from partner retailers. Users are not required to set up a personal Bitcoin wallet to begin earning; instead, Lolli credits rewards to an internal wallet system, managed via its own infrastructure. While [Lolli states](https://www.lolli.com/help) that it is not a custodian of bitcoin in a legal or regulatory sense, it acknowledges that users have a contractual right to redemption, and that it seeks to maintain assets backing user balances. Until withdrawal, funds are stored within Lolli’s environment, and the ability to redeem them is subject to conditions such as minimum balance thresholds and retailer confirmation periods. Therefore, [Lolli is custodial](https://www.lolli.com/help) in terms of access and control, despite its nuanced legal positioning.

- Rewards become withdrawable after a ~90-day confirmation period.  
- Bitcoin can be transferred to any address; USD to a U.S. bank (min. $15).  
- Redemption is subject to terms and platform availability.  
- Lolli retains full control over funds until withdrawal is initiated.
