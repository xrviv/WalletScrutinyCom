## App Description 

Atomic Wallet is a multi-cryptocurrency desktop wallet that supports bitcoin. It allows users to generate private keys upon initialization. However, it doesn't believe in Open Source, and only describes itself as "uses Open Source libraries". [More](https://support.atomicwallet.io/article/184-why-is-atomic-wallet-not-open-source) about this. Despite being partially source-available, it is **not fully open source** and thus not verifiable.
