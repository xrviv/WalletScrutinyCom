## App Description

This desktop app supports Bitcoin and has Linux, macOS and Windows variants. It supports a myriad of hardware signing devices and enforces hardware only seeds. Supported devices include: Coldcard, Coldcard Q, Bitbox02, Blockstream Jade, Trezor, Foundation Passport, Keystone, Ledger, Specter DIY, using QR, USB, and SD-card.

It features multi-signature support. Once the user is finished setting/pairing the hardware devices, the user can then send/receive through the interface of the program.

It has multiple languages and a user-friendly step-by-step wizard. 

The distinction between a companion app and a wallet requires a bit of nuance in this case. On one hand, seed generation and private key storage does not occur within the program, a hardware device is specifically required to do so. We may think that this qualifies the program as "merely" a companion app, but we cannot ignore the fact that it can generate PSBTs, and can create transactions. 

It is self-custodial, source-available and should be **for verification.**
