## App Description

Lightweight, but fully featured, Sparrow is a source-available program that allows users a full-range of capabilities to connect to Bitcoin Core as well as ColdCard. However, there's an open issue regarding the [ability to export WIF private keys from addresses.](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/issues/1445). The founder [notes](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/issues/1445#issuecomment-2589806288):

> There is another risk - if the attacker knows the xpub at the derivation path of the parent (e.g. m/84'/0'/0'/0) all of the private keys for the receive or change chain can be derived.

Sparrow is not just an app, but a philosophy-methodology in itself. It recommends that users act in accordance to the level of their belief in bitcoin. The more belief they have over it - the more they should have it. The more they have of it, the higher their security posture. These tiers could be found [here.](https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html#summary).

The seed phrases could be accessed under "Settings" > "Keystores". Self-custodial, and source-available this app should be **for verification**.
