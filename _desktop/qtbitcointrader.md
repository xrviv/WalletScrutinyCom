 <div class="alertBox"><div>**Security Advisory:** Notably, Qt Bitcoin Trader has been exploited in cyberattacks. For instance, <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/12/lazarus-group-uses-fake-cryptocurrency-apps-to-plant-applejeus-malware">North Korean hackers have used trojanized versions of the software to distribute malware</a>, such as the AppleJeus malware, targeting cryptocurrency users and exchanges. These incidents highlight the importance of downloading the application only from trusted sources and ensuring its authenticity before use.

It does not provide/store/create private keys, it also does not custody the user's private keys. It connects to centralized exchanges (e.g., Binance, Bitfinex, Bitstamp) using the API keys the user provides. This is **not a wallet**.
