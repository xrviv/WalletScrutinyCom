## Analysis

Jaxx Liberty, developed by Decentral Inc., was officially discontinued on March 27, 2023, as announced in their [official blog post](https://blog.jaxx.io/sunsetting-jaxx-liberty-what-you-need-to-know). The wallet's website (jaxx.io) now redirects to Edge Wallet ({% include walletLink.html wallet='android/co.edgesecure.app' verdict='true' %}), which was recommended as one of the primary migration options alongside Exodus Wallet.

The migration process relied on users' 12-word backup phrases, allowing them to restore their wallets in the new environment while maintaining control of their private keys.

With the service now completely defunct, users must migrate to alternative solutions to maintain access to their digital assets. 

This app has a verdict of  **defunct**.
