## Analysis

Jaxx Liberty, developed by Decentral Inc., was officially discontinued on March 27, 2023, as announced in their [official blog post](https://blog.jaxx.io/sunsetting-jaxx-liberty-what-you-need-to-know). The wallet's website (jaxx.io) now redirects to Edge Wallet ({% include walletLink.html wallet='android/co.edgesecure.app' verdict='true' %}), which was recommended as one of the primary migration options alongside Exodus Wallet.

The migration process relied on users' 12-word backup phrases, allowing them to restore their wallets in the new environment while maintaining control of their private keys.

With the service now completely **defunct**, users must migrate to alternative solutions to maintain access to their digital assets. Previously, it was only partially source-available which gives it a historical verdict of **not source available**.
