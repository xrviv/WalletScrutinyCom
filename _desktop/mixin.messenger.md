## App Description:

Mixin Messenger is a cross-platform desktop application for Linux, macOS, and Windows that combines an open-source cryptocurrency wallet with secure Signal-based messaging. Designed with security and decentralization in mind, it features a self-custodial MPC wallet, built-in 2FA resistant to mnemonic leaks, and anonymous account creation via mnemonic phrases. Users can swap thousands of native cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, and XMR, send assets directly to contacts with zero fees, and recover wallets using mnemonic phrases, trusted contacts, or phone numbers.

**Note:** the desktop application would still require downloading the Android app.
