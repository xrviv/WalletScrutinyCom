## App Description from [its Repository](https://github.com/KoinKeep/GateKeeper)

> GateKeeper is a tool for verifying withdrawal transactions and more. It will verify that your Bitcoin wallet is not lying or stealing from you.

>
> - After a withdrawal transaction is created.
> - Before a transaction is published.

This is a Bitcoin-related utility tool, but **not a wallet**.
