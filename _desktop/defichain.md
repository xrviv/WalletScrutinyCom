## App Description

â€‹DeFiChain is a distinct blockchain platform that, while originating as a fork of Bitcoin Core, has evolved to operate independently with its own consensus mechanisms, token (DFI), and blockchain infrastructure. 

From the website:

> Desktop Full-Node Wallet
>
> Transact, liquidity mine, swap and more with the full-featured and fully-decentralized wallet app. Full node included.

Once downloaded, the AppImage is named "DeFi-Wallet-4.2.5.AppImage"

All branding and terminology is bereft of any reference to Bitcoin. We terminated the program before we can see most of its functionalities - since it is persisting to download the DeFi chain blockchain. As of 2025-04-24 21:40 the software is at block height 4965730 while Bitcoin block height is at 893768 - proving that its not the Bitcoin blockchain.

This app **does not support Bitcoin**.
