Simple BitcoinJ GUI Wallet is a minimalistic, open-source Bitcoin wallet built using JavaFX and the BitcoinJ library. It is intended as a lightweight educational or experimental desktop wallet and operates on Bitcoin's testnet by default.

The project has seen limited development activity and minimal community engagement. It is suitable for developers or users seeking a basic Java-based Bitcoin wallet, but it may not be appropriate for production use without further maintenance or review. Its a project that was started but **never really finished**, and now its forgotten.
