> Nunchuk is a self-custodial wallet developed using open standards (seed phrase backup is defined in BIP39, while wallet configuration backup is defined in BIP129). That means you always have complete control over your funds. As long as you maintain proper backups, you can recover your Nunchuk wallets elsewhere. Please click here to see our recovery guides.
