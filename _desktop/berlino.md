## App Description

â€‹Berlino is an open-source "simple Bitcoin wallet" project hosted on GitHub which aims to provide a minimalistic and straightforward user experience. This is a command line only app that uses the dotnet sdk. 

We tested and built berlino by installing the dotnet sdk. To date, the cli application has no executable and no visible means to generate, store, encrypt private keys. At this point in its development, we still **can't say it's a wallet** despite its description.
