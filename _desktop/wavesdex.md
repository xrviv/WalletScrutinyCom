## Analysis

Waves Decentralized Exchange (WavesDex) has been discontinued and migrated to a new platform called {% include walletLink.html wallet='desktop/wxnetwork' verdict='true' %}. The GitHub repository for WavesDex shows no activity since March 1, 2019, when version 1.0.42 was released, indicating that development on the original application has ceased.

Visiting the Waves.Exchange website displays a prominent message: "Waves.Exchange has moved to the new WX.Network domain. Please migrate your accounts." This confirms that the original WavesDex platform is no longer being maintained and users are being directed to the successor platform.

Despite the migration notice, the website footer still shows "©2025 Waves.Exchange Version 2.3.38" and provides a support email (support@waves.exchange), suggesting that some basic maintenance of the website continues even as the platform itself has been deprecated.

The WX.Network desktop application appears to be the direct successor to WavesDex, offering similar functionality for cryptocurrency trading and investment. However, unlike the original WavesDex, there is no publicly available repository for the WX.Network desktop application, making it impossible to verify its code.

Based on this evidence, we are classifying the original Waves Decentralized Exchange (WavesDex) as **deprecated**, as it has been officially replaced by WX.Network and is no longer being actively developed or maintained.
