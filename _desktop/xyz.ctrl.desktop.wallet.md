## App Description

This is the successor to {% include walletLink.html wallet='desktop/xdefi_wallet' verdict='true' %} after going through a rebrand. The browser extension allows adding the BTC network, which would enable users to send and receive BTC. It secures the wallet with a 12-word seed phrase. However, when we searched in their GitHub organization page, we could not find any repository that could point to its browser extension.

We did not find any claim on its website that this browser extension is source-available. We were also not able to find any chrome extension in its [GitHub organization page.](https://github.com/orgs/XDeFi-tech/repositories?type=all). The browser extension is **not source-available.**
