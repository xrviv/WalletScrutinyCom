## Analysis

OpenBazaar, a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace that utilized cryptocurrency for transactions, has ceased active development. The project's GitHub repository was officially archived on March 29, 2023, marking the end of code maintenance and updates. This archival status represents a definitive indicator of the project's discontinued state.

While the OpenBazaar website (openbazaar.org) continues to display a message about "OpenBazaar 3.0 - coming soon," our investigation reveals no substantial development activity since 2021. There were discussions about reviving the project in 2023, but these efforts did not materialize into tangible progress. Monitoring of the official social media channels, particularly the X (formerly Twitter) account @openbazaar, shows no official communications or development updates throughout 2024 and into 2025.

The absence of active development, combined with the archived status of the codebase and lack of official communications, clearly indicates that OpenBazaar is **defunct**. Users who previously relied on this platform for decentralized commerce should transition to alternative solutions, as the software is no longer maintained and may contain security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues with current operating systems.
