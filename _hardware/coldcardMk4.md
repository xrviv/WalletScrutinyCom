> "Edge" for the Coldcard Mk4 refers to an experimental firmware build available on the Coldcard downloads page. This version includes the latest, cutting‐edge features and improvements that are still under testing and refinement, so while it offers early access to new functionalities, it may be less stable than the official, fully vetted firmware releases. Users opting for Edge firmware should be comfortable with potential bugs or issues and ideally back up their data before updating.

## Update for Stable Version: 2025-02-20: 

The stable release v5.4.1 is the most recent, we would be reviewing that next.

The [coldcard.sh script](https://gitlab.com/walletscrutiny/walletScrutinyCom/-/blob/master/scripts/test/hardware/coldCard.sh) strips the signature section that appears in the address range **0x3f800-0x3ff00** (which is near the end of the firmware), effectively removing the signature header while preserving the actual firmware code for comparison. The firmware starts at byte 293 while the total firmware size is 946,176 bytes.


# Old Analysis

## Product Description 

The ColdCard Mark 4 is CoinKite's latest iteration of the ColdCard series. At the time of this writing, the Mark 4 is still in pre-order. The current product in the series is the {% include walletLink.html wallet='hardware/coldcardMk3' verdict='true' %}. 

Claimed features of the Coldcard Mark 4:

> - USB-C Connector
> - Unlimited Memory, no Bitcoin Transaction size restrictions
> - NFC Tap for all data types, PSBT, Address, etc...
> - Slide Cover
> - Even more security, Dual SE (Secure Elements)
> - Extensive duress PIN optionality
> - Multi-vendor SE
> - USB Virtual Disk mode
> - New 2x secure elements design (multi vendor)
> - New plastic
> - Faster Processor

Specs:

> - Speed: 120 Mhz main CPU (was 80Mhz)
> - Memmory: 840kb + 8M RAM (was only 360kb) - This is where we process transactions.
> - Flash memory: for firmware doubled! (now ~1.5M, was ~700M)
> - Settings memory: now 512kb (was 4kb)
> - PSRAM used instead of flash to hold PSBT and Transaction (faster workspace)
> - Replaceable OLED display (same size, resolution but better supplier)
> - Hardware SHA256 & AES engine (faster encryption/decription)
> - Multi-vendor dual Secure Element [SE] new design (Microchip 608A + )
> - New USB LED flashes when USB is active
> - USB-C connector
> - NFC V capability and exposed trace for permanent disable

Functions: 

> - Unlimited transaction size
> - More multisig wallets possible
> - Firmware upgrade more secure, faster: 15 seconds using USB vs. 2 minutes
> - Nearly same great price when you add inflation!
> - Boots much faster
> - New "trick pins" allow for endless duress labyrinth. Instant wipe or brick or wipe and continue into duress, etc...
> - Sliding case cover protects screen when COLDCARD is hidden and not in use
> - NFC communications integrated
> - USB disk emulation for simple use w/ web browsers and other PSBT sources
> - Bootrom contains anti-chip shouter/glitching protections which reduce timing certainty
> - Countdown to login feature improved: fast wipe
External settings chip removed. Setting now internal to MCU (faster, more space for settings)
> - Kill-key feature: press key N while phishing words shown -> fast wipe+stop (not silent)
> - Debug serial port moved to pins, rather than being virtual over USB
